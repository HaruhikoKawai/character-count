# What can this code do?

Count the number of characters in a text file

##What is the purpose of creating this code?

Have you ever felt like this while writing a report?
“Darn it! The professor assigned me to write a report with ○○ characters, but I have no idea how many I’ve written so far!”
Well, great news for you!
With this code, you can easily find out exactly how many characters you’ve written. Revolutionary, right? Don’t you think so?
Now you can focus entirely on writing your report! Isn’t that awesome?
Let me show you how to install and use it in a simple and easy-to-understand way below. Give it a try!

And hey, let’s make a deal — no saying, “Wouldn’t Word do this already?” Alright, buddy?
